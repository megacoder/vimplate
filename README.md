# vimplate
Resurrection of https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=198
## Original Author
Shamelessly appropriated from *template file loader* by Scott Urban as told by https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=198
## Why This Repo?
The original vim.org content seems a bit dated, not being updated since 2002-02-23, but looks to be a quick and lean templating system.  I'm just after something simple, hardly more than auto boilerplate insertion.
## Mea Culpa
* All credit to the original author thomas.scott.urban@gmail.com
* All bugs originated my your humble code resurrector.
